* [ ] make __typing__ in code consistent
  * [ ] visualization
  * [ ] dataCreation
  * [ ] Classifier

## Logical progress
* [x] Correct Data creation (--> todos in dataCreation.md)
* [x] validate results from decision tree (how close classes actually are)
* [x] make __HiCS implementation__ work
* [x] load and save data from data classes properly
* [x] save tree and corresponding visualization
* [x] make sure HiCS doesnt get to see more columns than its supposed to
* [ ] think about HiCS Parameters
* [ ] official paperwork for thesis (need to wait for Daniel to hear about approval of 
request)
* [ ] finish implementation __QSM__ in Python (--> todos QSM.md)
* [ ] plan progress for whole thesis
* [ ] find implementation for __Binning__
* [ ] make implementation for __Binning__ work
* [ ] refactor training / prediction process of decision trees (prediction not needed)
* [ ] maybe change dataset to show weaknesses of vanilla QSM better

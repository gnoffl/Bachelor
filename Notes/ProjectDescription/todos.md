# TODOs

## General todos

* [ ] __comment code__
  * [ ] QSM
* [ ] make __proper notes__ of things that were already done
  * [ ] QSM
* [ ] make __typing__ in code consistent
  * [ ] visualization
  * [ ] dataCreation
  * [ ] Classifier
  * [ ] QSM


## Logical progress

* [ ] think about HiCS Parameters (read HiCS paper again)
* [ ] extract all tuning parameters into one file -> think about values
* [ ] finish implementation __QSM__ (--> todos QSM.md)
* [ ] add some outputs, so a sense of progression is given
* [ ] plan progress for whole thesis
* [ ] remaining todos from Binning.md
* [ ] implement execution of QSM on subsets of a given dataset
* [ ] iris Dataset
* [ ] Soccer Dataset
* [ ] NN classifier for Soccer



# Done

* [x] Correct Data creation (--> todos in dataCreation.md)
* [x] validate results from decision tree (how close classes actually are)
* [x] make __HiCS implementation__ work
* [x] load and save data from data classes properly
* [x] save tree and corresponding visualization
* [x] make sure HiCS doesnt get to see more columns than its supposed to
* [x] official paperwork for thesis (need to wait for Daniel to hear about
approval of request)
* [x] refactor training / prediction process of decision trees (prediction not
needed)
* [x] change dataset to show weaknesses of vanilla QSM better (no overlap of
class_05 with any other class in dim_04)

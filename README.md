# Improved QSM
[Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) is needed to execute most functionality.

To run the improved QSM, create Dataset and use "run_from_file" from main.py, as shwon in the current code.
Parameters will be loaded from "parameters.txt" in the folder "Data".

Results for the Bachelor Thesis were created using "parameter_search" in ParameterSearch.py

More detailed descriptions for some files can be found in the folder "Notes/ProjectDescription".

    notes: this Dataset was created by duplicating metadata from another Dataset.
           -------------------
           This dataset results from splitting a parent dataset.
           split criterion: petal_width < 1.4
           number of data points: 28
           -------------------
           recursive_splitting was called on this dataset with the following parameters:
           dim_to_shift = petal_length
           min_split_size = 8
           remaining_splits = 0
           visualize = True
           data set not split further because maximum number of splits was reached!
           -------------------
           notes for QSM:
           prediction on the original data in column "org_pred_classes_QSM"
           shifted column "petal_length" by 0.05. Shifted column is "petal_length_shifted_by_0.05", corresponding predictions are in column "pred_with_petal_length_shifted_by_0.05"
